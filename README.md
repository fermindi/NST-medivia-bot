# NST üìå
*Welcome to the Nebel's Slacking Tools (NST) readme, I encourage you to read it before getting in with the software, I'll keep it short, I promise :)*

The NST are developed to enhance your mana training in a convenient way, helping you not missing any single mana point.

Completely built with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and using image recognition and mouse/keyboard inputs, it's not detectable unless a GM catches you.


# HOW TO USE ‚öôÔ∏è
### 1- SPELL
The spell box is your input spell to the game, it will be casted always in the default channel.
The "needs blank rune" checkbox will check for blank runes at your inventory, if none found, an error pops.

### 2- HAND
Basically in which hand you want to get the blank rune, by default left, if it's not empty, an error pops.

### 3- CHECK
The check box is the time in which it will check again if you have enough mana and resources to repeat the process, always must be numbers and the time in seconds,
by default 300 seconds (5 minutes).

### 4- FOOD
Which food you want to eat, it will check if you have it in your inventory and right-click 4 times on it. if none found, an error pops.

### IMPORTANT NOTES üî¥
- The SPELL will be cast _**ONLY if you got more than half mana, not configurable**_ at X manapoints.

- If "needs blank rune" is checked, the _**selected hand always must be EMPTY**_.
